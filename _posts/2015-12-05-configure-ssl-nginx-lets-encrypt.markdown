Here are a few tools that can help us make sure our configuration is secure :

- [SSL Labs Server Test](https://www.ssllabs.com/ssltest/index.html) - A complete SSL certificate test of your domains. They even suggest recommendations of what to improve.
- [SSL Decoder](https://ssldecoder.org) - Another online SSL test utility
- [Certificate Expiry Monitor](https://certificatemonitor.org) - This project will scan your domain's certificate daily and warn you when it's about to expire
